DESCRIPTION:
    An INNOVATIVE (not really) and CAPTIVATING (hopefully) RPG created by ZENX2.

THE DREAM:
    Create an RPG, based on a NEW-FANGLED FANTASY LAND called AIREDALE. There are
    many things to do in Airedale, from killing monsters to making magical armor
    with no real uniquity or special properties, to starting a fist fight with
    your friends in the middle of town.

FEATURES:
    Free movement (not a grid)
    Online multiplayer, server based
    Enemies that do pathfinding and whatnot
    Many items that can be used from inside your inventory (health potions etc.)
        and outside as weapons (swords, knives, maces, axes, etc.)
